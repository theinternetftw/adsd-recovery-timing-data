# asds-recovery-timing-data

This is a small project for recording and comparing the time required for processing a landed Falcon 9 core after its return from an ASDS.

Its contents are some json, a validation script, and a converter to allow for [display on the /r/spacex wiki.](https://www.reddit.com/r/SpaceX/wiki/recovery_timing)

The timing information comes from /r/spacex and NSF recovery threads.
